- Use bun instead of npm.
- Run "bun run build" after succesful task and fix any error come out from the build.
- I use windows, and any power shell command please use right code.
- I deployed frontend to netlify.
- Always prioritize security first rather than just to complete the code.
- Security first: Never compromise security to speed up development. Validate inputs, sanitize data, use environment variables for secrets, and follow security best practices.
- Maintainability: Break down long files into smaller, focused modules. Aim for functions under 50 lines when possible.
- Reusability: Create reusable components and utilities. Extract repeated logic into shared functions.
- Separation of concerns: Keep business logic, UI components, and data access layers separate.
